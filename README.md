# DungeonCrawler
Dungeon Crawler is a 2D, top-down dungeon exploration game built in Java.
The game combines randomly generated levels, unique enemies and engaging in melee combat.
Players navigate through a dungeon, battling slimes and finally a Boss.
The game has adjusted scaling, it can be played on different-sized screens or resolutions and still looks the same.
Four basic songs are added to the menu, and the entities all have walking, idle, and death animation.
